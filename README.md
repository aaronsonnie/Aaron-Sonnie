# Power Manager Telemetry Tool

The deployment of devices across various locations has led to a significant increase in power consumption in this modern Technology. This rise emphasizes the urgent need for corporations and governments worldwide to implement strategies for achieving net-zero power consumption. Furthermore, with electricity prices on the rise, understanding and managing the total power drawn by systems is becoming increasingly crucial for both economic and environmental reasons.

## Project Objectives

This project aims to address the challenges of power management by focusing on the following objectives:

1. **Research Open-Source Tools**: Identify and evaluate available open-source tools that can be utilized for accurate power measurement.
2. **Document System Knobs**: Catalog the various configurable parameters within a system that can influence power consumption metrics.
3. **Telemetry Data Collection**: Gather telemetry data from key components such as the CPU, memory, Network Interface Card (NIC), and Thermal Design Power (TDP).
4. **Power Utilization Measurement**: Measure and record system power utilization, focusing specifically on CPU, NIC, and TDP based on varying input parameters related to system utilization percentages.

## Docker Integration

Utilizing Docker for containerization ensures a consistent and portable environment for running the Python GUI application. This approach helps mitigate dependency issues and eases deployment across different systems.

### Steps to Use Docker

1. **Create a Dockerfile**: This file describes the necessary environment for running your application.
2. **Build the Docker Image**: Use the Dockerfile to create an image that encapsulates your application and its dependencies.
3. **Run the Container**: Start a container from your image, specifying parameters such as CPU loading percentage and the duration of the test.

## Installation Steps

1. **Install System Dependencies**:
   - Download the `install_dependencies.sh` script from the repository and execute the following commands in your terminal:
     ```bash
     chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
     ./install_dependencies.sh
     ```

2. **Install Docker**:
   - Download the `Step1-install_docker.sh` script and run:
     ```bash
     chmod +x Step1-install_docker.sh
     ./Step1-install_docker.sh
     ```

3. **Create Dockerfile**:
   - Create a Dockerfile using the command:
     ```bash
     vi Dockerfile
     ```
   - Copy the contents from `Step2-Create Dockerfile` into your new Dockerfile.
```
